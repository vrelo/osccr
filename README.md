Open Source Closed Circuit Rebreather

## What is it? 

Welcome to Project OSCCR, where we're pushing the limits of underwater adventure! We're building an open-source, side-mount scuba rebreather that's compact, lightweight, and perfect for mixed-gas diving. Whether you're exploring mysterious caves or just love a good DIY challenge, join us in crafting gear that’s as adventurous as you are. Remember, it's all about diving deep, having fun, and embracing the spirit of innovation—just with a healthy respect for the risks!
